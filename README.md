This project revolves around 5 main components.
- The User Interface is a web application that allows users to interact with the application.
- The User Service maintains all the user-related operations starting from registering to maintaining the user details.
- The Purchase Service handles all the purchase-related requests from the user interface. The Purchase Service also acts as a load balancer and communicates with the user interface, budget service, user service, and the database.
- The Budget Service manages the budget set by the user.
- The database stores all the records generated by the user.
